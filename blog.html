            <h3 class="date">1 March 2016</h3>
            <p>A year in, we're changing the name of the company to C&amp;Adoctor.com because it's shorter, doesn't require explaining to non-programmers, and is much easier to type. </p>
            <p><a href="mailto:help@cnadoctor.com">Email</a> if you want our new stickers!

            <h2>Back Doors in Cryptosystems</h2>
            <h3 class="date">26 November 2015</h3>
            <p>If we design weaknesses into our own system, some of the bad guys will use a different system (one without weaknesses) instead. Others will exploit the weaknesses in our system to hurt us.</p>
            <p>There's little evidence that non-state actors use encryption much anyway; but if they want it, there are plenty of alternatives designed and implemented outside the USA that they could use instead. Much more likely, I think, is that the back door key would be compromised and exploited almost immediately, as happened with DVD copy protection and region codes. </p>
            <p>The entire debate is a repeat of 1993, when a similar proposal was floated for an official cryptosystem (the Clipper chip) with a designed-in back door called the Law Enforcement Access Field, or LEAF. Way back in the 1970s, the first official data encryption standard (DES), used by banks to protect their wire transfers, was deliberately weakened. That time, it was done more cleverly: the fact that DES was weakened was obvious to mathematicians at the time, but it was also obvious that it could only be exploited by an entity with the computational resources of NSA. It was a safe bet at the time that no one else on the planet had NSA's computational resources. This time is different; they're proposing a weakness the control of which would be administrative, not controlled by the laws of physics. The key, literally, would be a key — steal a copy of that key, and you're in. (I've seen no actual technical proposal, only political calls for one; a sensible way to design such a thing would have multiple keys, for both accountability and damage control, but the principle stands: control of access to the keys would be administrative, not proof-of-work, and that's weak.) </p>
            <p>It seems to me that if a system like this were mandated, and was therefore in widespread use, that there would be correspondingly frequent calls for use of the ‘back door key’ in investigations. Each time would be an opportunity for control of the key to be lost, compromised, stolen. A concrete example of this happened last year with ‘TSA approved’ luggage padlocks. A few years ago, laws were passed that said that airport inspectors were allowed to cut off locks on suitcases they wanted to inspect. Special padlocks could be bought by travellers who wanted to lock their suitcases; these ‘TSA approved’ locks could be opened by master keys that only airport inspectors possessed. The government was so proud of this technical solution that they put a photo on their web site of an officer holding a ring of the special keys. A high resolution photo. Within days, people had successfully copied the bitting patterns of all the keys from the photo. Complete sets of keys can now be purchased on EBay.</p>
            <p>The government tells us that without controls on data encryption, police investigations will ‘go dark’. But that's contradicted by two facts: firstly, good encryption has been widely available for twenty years; prompted, in fact by the 1993 proposal, lots of really good free software was written, and lots of companies started selling it as well. (The only reason it's not widely used — except by nerds — is that it's a pain in the neck to use. Terrorists don't use it for the same reason.) Secondly, despite the existence for twenty years of very effective crypto software that's free for anyone to use (or easy to buy if you want a commercial product that comes with a warranty), law enforcement investigations have not gone dark; the number of wiretaps approved by the FISA court and the number of national security letters issued to librarians and network operators and email administrators — the number of which is public record — has increased dramatically since 9/11. They wouldn't be asking for approval for tens of thousands of wiretaps if wiretaps weren't working.</p>
            <p>It's not even possible to argue this one as a Devil's advocate; I tried just now. No law I can think of would work completely. The most straightforward way to attempt it would be to employ ‘reverse entropy detectors’ on the Internet: i.e., any traffic not using approved encryption methods would be dropped. However, an easy countermeasure would be steganography — and that uses the laws of physics right back against you. It's a logical contradiction. The horse is out of the barn; locking the door won't work any more.
